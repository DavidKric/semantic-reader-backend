# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Docker Deployment and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker configuration and comprehensive documentation for the project.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment
2. Configure Docker to install all dependencies and run the API service
3. Update README.md with comprehensive usage instructions
4. Add examples for both library and API usage
5. Document RTL support and any differences from original PaperMage
6. Create sample notebooks or scripts demonstrating usage
7. Add deployment instructions for various environments
8. Document configuration options and environment variables
9. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
10. Create release process documentation

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker deployment works by:
1. Building the Docker image
2. Running the container
3. Testing API endpoints through the container
4. Verifying documentation accuracy by following the instructions
5. Testing CI/CD pipeline with a sample commit

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Build [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an efficient Dockerfile using multi-stage build pattern to minimize image size and improve security. Configure it to install all dependencies and run the API service properly.
### Details:
1. Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (node_modules, .git, etc.)
2. Implement a multi-stage Dockerfile with build and production stages
3. Use specific version tags for base images (avoid 'latest' tag)
4. Configure proper working directory and file copying
5. Set up non-root user for security
6. Add HEALTHCHECK instruction to monitor container health
7. Expose only necessary ports
8. Configure proper CMD or ENTRYPOINT for running the API service
9. Test the Dockerfile by building and running locally
10. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and the service runs as expected

## 2. Set Up Docker Compose for Development and Production [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a Docker Compose configuration to simplify deployment in different environments and handle multi-container setups if needed.
### Details:
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with service definitions
2. Configure environment-specific overrides with docker-compose.override.yml
3. Set up appropriate environment variables
4. Configure resource limits (memory, CPU) for containers
5. Set up volume mappings for persistent data
6. Configure networking between containers if needed
7. Add healthcheck configurations
8. Set up proper restart policies
9. Test the compose setup in development mode
10. Verify production mode configuration works as expected
11. Document any differences between development and production setups

## 3. Create Comprehensive README and Usage Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Update the project README.md with comprehensive usage instructions, examples, and documentation of features including RTL support and differences from the original PaperMage.
### Details:
1. Create a clear project overview section
2. Document installation instructions (both with and without Docker)
3. Add usage examples for both library and API usage
4. Create a dedicated section for RTL support features
5. Document differences from original PaperMage
6. Add screenshots or diagrams where helpful
7. Include troubleshooting section for common issues
8. Document all configuration options and environment variables
9. Add badges for build status, version, etc.
10. Ensure documentation follows a logical structure with proper headings
11. Have someone else review the documentation for clarity

## 4. Develop Sample Notebooks and Usage Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create sample Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and code examples demonstrating various use cases and features of the project.
### Details:
1. Create a dedicated 'examples' directory in the repository
2. Develop at least 3 Jupyter notebooks showing different use cases
3. Create sample Python scripts for common operations
4. Add examples for API usage with curl/Postman/etc.
5. Include examples of configuration options
6. Create examples demonstrating RTL support
7. Add examples for any advanced features
8. Ensure examples are well-commented and follow best practices
9. Test all examples to ensure they work as documented
10. Link to these examples from the main README.md

## 5. Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, including Docker image building, testing, and release process automation.
### Details:
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
2. Set up CI workflow to build and test the Docker image on pull requests
3. Configure CD workflow to build and push Docker images to a registry on releases
4. Add vulnerability scanning for Docker images using tools like Trivy
5. Set up automated testing within the CI pipeline
6. Configure release automation to generate release notes
7. Add status badges to README.md
8. Create documentation for the release process
9. Document how to use the CI/CD pipeline for contributors
10. Set up notifications for CI/CD failures
11. Test the complete workflow to ensure it functions correctly
