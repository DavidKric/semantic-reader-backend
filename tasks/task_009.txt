# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create End-to-End Tests
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests comparing PaperMage-Docling output with original PaperMage.
# Details:
1. Create tests/testendtoend.py with full pipeline tests
2. Obtain reference outputs from original PaperMage for comparison
3. Implement tests that compare our output to PaperMage reference outputs
4. Add tests for different document types (academic papers, multi-column layouts, etc.)
5. Create tests specifically for RTL documents
6. Test performance on larger documents
7. Implement tolerance for minor numerical differences in coordinates
8. Test both direct API calls and HTTP API endpoints
9. Document any acceptable differences from original PaperMage

# Test Strategy:
Run end-to-end tests with various document types and verify:
1. Output structure matches PaperMage's format
2. Entity counts and content match expected values
3. RTL text is handled correctly
4. Performance meets requirements
5. No regressions in functionality compared to original PaperMage

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up E2E Testing Framework and Environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for end-to-end testing by setting up the testing framework, directory structure, and test environment configuration that will allow for systematic comparison between PaperMage-Docling and original PaperMage outputs.
### Details:
1. Create a new `tests/testendtoend.py` file and establish the basic testing structure using pytest
2. Set up test fixtures that initialize both PaperMage and PaperMage-Docling with identical configurations
3. Create helper functions for comparing outputs with configurable tolerance levels for numerical differences
4. Implement utility functions to load and process test documents
5. Set up a mechanism to capture and log differences between outputs
6. Configure pytest to generate detailed HTML reports using pytest-html
7. Create a test configuration file to manage test parameters and tolerance settings
8. Add documentation for the testing approach and framework design
9. Testing approach: Use pytest's parametrization to run the same tests with different configurations

## 2. Implement Core Document Processing Comparison Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create tests that compare the fundamental document processing capabilities between PaperMage-Docling and original PaperMage, focusing on token extraction, text recognition, and basic document structure analysis.
### Details:
1. Obtain reference outputs from original PaperMage for a set of simple test documents
2. Implement test cases that compare token extraction results (position, text content, metadata)
3. Create tests for document structure analysis (paragraphs, sections, headings)
4. Add tests for basic text recognition accuracy and completeness
5. Implement tolerance handling for minor numerical differences in coordinates and dimensions
6. Test both direct API calls and HTTP API endpoints for core functionality
7. Document any acceptable differences between implementations
8. Testing approach: Use data-driven testing to run the same tests against multiple document samples
9. Implement detailed assertion messages that clearly identify where and how outputs differ

## 3. Develop Layout and Multi-column Document Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create specialized tests for complex document layouts, focusing on multi-column documents, tables, figures, and other complex layout elements that are challenging for document understanding systems.
### Details:
1. Collect a diverse set of multi-column academic papers and documents with complex layouts
2. Obtain reference outputs from original PaperMage for these documents
3. Implement tests that verify correct column detection and reading order
4. Create tests for table structure recognition and extraction
5. Add tests for figure detection and caption association
6. Implement tests for footnotes, headers, and footers handling
7. Test layout-specific features like margin detection and page segmentation
8. Document any layout-specific differences between implementations
9. Testing approach: Use visual comparison tools to highlight layout differences in addition to data structure comparisons

## 4. Implement Special Document Type Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create tests for special document types including RTL (Right-to-Left) documents, documents with mixed languages, and documents with special characters or non-standard fonts.
### Details:
1. Collect test documents with RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew) and mixed language content
2. Obtain reference outputs from original PaperMage for these special documents
3. Implement tests specifically for RTL text direction handling
4. Create tests for mixed language detection and processing
5. Add tests for special character rendering and recognition
6. Implement tests for documents with non-standard fonts
7. Test handling of documents with mixed RTL and LTR content
8. Document any differences in special document type handling
9. Testing approach: Focus on character-level and word-level comparisons rather than just layout for these specialized tests

## 5. Develop Performance and Scale Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create tests that evaluate the performance characteristics and scalability of PaperMage-Docling compared to the original PaperMage, focusing on processing time, memory usage, and behavior with large documents.
### Details:
1. Collect a set of large documents (50+ pages) and documents with high-resolution images
2. Obtain reference outputs and performance metrics from original PaperMage
3. Implement tests that measure and compare processing time for different document sizes
4. Create tests that monitor memory usage during document processing
5. Add tests for batch processing capabilities and efficiency
6. Implement stress tests with multiple concurrent document processing requests
7. Test performance degradation patterns as document complexity increases
8. Document performance differences and trade-offs between implementations
9. Testing approach: Use pytest-benchmark for consistent performance measurements and generate comparative performance reports
